### Create a new project directory with an index.html and main.js file
### Link your main.js file with your index.html file by adding <script src="main.js"></script> just before the /body tag in the index.html file


Create and assign variable for all JavaScript data types

You should console.log the typeof each variable like below and discuss the results.

let x = 'Sally Smith';
console.log(typeof x);

Mutate each variable and console.log typeof each
