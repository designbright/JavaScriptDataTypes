# JavaScriptDataTypes

## JavaScript Primitive Data Types

There are two categories of data types
1. Primitives
2. Objects

There are five primitive types:
1. string
- Example: "hello there!", 'hello there'

2. number
- Example: 1, 200, 3.14159

3. boolean
- Example: true, false
4. undefined
- Example: undefined is the default value for any variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value
5. null

## Getting Started

### Create a new project directory with an index.html and main.js file
### Link your main.js file with your index.html file by adding <script src="main.js"></script> just before the /body tag in the index.html file


Create and assign variable for all JavaScript data types

You should console.log the typeof each variable like below and discuss the results.

let x = 'Sally Smith';
console.log(typeof x);

Mutate each variable and console.log typeof each
Perform mathematical operations using mixed data types and console.log typeof each
